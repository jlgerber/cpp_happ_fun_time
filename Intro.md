# Introduction
This little group of sessions represents my rather feable attempt at helping some of our python developers learn c++. Unlike a book which starts from scratch, we are going to assume a certain level of competence with python and use that as a reference.

C++ as a language is going through a lot of changes. What is idiomatic C++ in the C++98 standard may not be in the c++11, C++14, or C++17 standards. So, we will be touching on that. Unfortunately, our need to write plugins for popular DCCs leaves us lagging relatively far behind, unable to take advantage of anything beyond C++11...
 
 In order to help understand what Idiomatic C++ is, a number of big names in the C++ field are putting together guidelines hosted on github. This effort is being spearheaded by Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, and Herb Sutter, another big brain. It is worth reading.
