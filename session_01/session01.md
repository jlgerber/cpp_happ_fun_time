# Introduction
a
C++ is a strongly typed, compiled, high performance language, which evolved from c, sharing its syntax and ability to interface with hardware. It can be used to write very close to the metal code, as well as highly abstracted code. C++ places more responsibilities on the developer, and it is likely that the two which will be the most alien are memory management and type cognizance. However, the big payoff in taking these responsibilities on is the ability ( notice i didnt say guarantee ) of producing high performance code.
