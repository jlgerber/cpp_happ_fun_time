    name: Look Homeward Angel
    author: Thomas Wolfe
    opening:
        A destiny that leads the English to the Dutch is strange enough; but one that leads from Epsom into Pennsylvania,
        and thence into the hills that shut Altamont over the proud coral cry of the cock, and the soft stone smile of
        an angel, is touched by the dark miracle of chance which makes new magic in a dusty world.

    name: Speak, Memory
    author: Vladimir Nabokov
    opening:
      The cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our existence is but a brief crack of light between
      two eternities of darkness. Although the two are identical twins, man, as a rule, views the prenatal abyss with
      more calm than the one he is heading for.
